# Task Manager

## Description

This repository is an updated version of a task manager I previously that used only HTML, CSS, and Javascript and local storage within the browser. This new version uses jsx/html, css, javascript (node.js/express) and MongoDB. This will be an on going project of an "project management" program 
I plan to make.


## Future 

Created with:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for style
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Node.js and Express for server-side development
- MongoDB for storing data


## Next TO-DO

    Style with css, add updating tasks and deleting tasks functionality.
